## Modifying/Adding code

Most of the SDK is generated from the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi), and any modifications to generated code will be overwritten on the next generation. Code generation and most of the day-to-day work that goes into this library is currently done upstream. Because of this, we are currently not able to effectively accept community contributions in many areas. Our goal is to move to a more open source workflow, and we are actively refining this process so that our team and the community can collaborate in this repository in the future.
