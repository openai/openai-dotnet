# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the OpenAI .NET library! This guide provides information about the repository structure, development setup, and workflows.

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `api/` | Public API listings (`OpenAI.net*.cs`) generated by `Export-Api.ps1`. Used to track breaking changes. |
| `codegen/` | TypeSpec emitter and C# generator plugins that transform TypeSpec definitions into C# code. |
| `docs/` | Guides and documentation, including .NET 10 single-file samples. |
| `examples/` | Usage examples organized by feature area (Chat, Audio, Images, Assistants, etc.). |
| `scripts/` | PowerShell scripts for development workflows (code generation, API export, testing). |
| `specification/` | TypeSpec definitions — `main.tsp` imports from `base/` (shared definitions) and `client/` (client customizations). |
| `src/` | Library source code — `Generated/` contains generated code, `Custom/` contains hand-written customizations, and `Utility/` contains helper classes. |
| `tests/` | NUnit tests with `SessionRecords/` for recorded playback mode. |

## Prerequisites

The following tools are required for development:

- **.NET SDK 10.0.100+** — Required version is specified in `global.json`. Install from the [.NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0).
- **Node.js** — Required for TypeSpec compilation and code generation. Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **PowerShell** — Required for running development scripts. Available by default on Windows; install [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) on macOS/Linux.

## Building the Library

Build the library from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet build OpenAI.slnx
```

For a release build:

```bash
dotnet build OpenAI.slnx -c Release
```

## Running Tests

### Recorded Mode (Default)

Tests run against pre-recorded session data by default, so no API key is required:

```bash
dotnet test OpenAI.slnx
```

### Live Mode

To run tests against the live OpenAI API, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
# PowerShell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key"

# Bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Then run the tests. The test framework will use the live API and can record new session data into `tests/SessionRecords/`.

## Code Generation

The library is generated from [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/) definitions located in the `specification/` folder. The base API definitions are in `specification/base/`, and client-specific customizations are in `specification/client/`.

### Regenerating Code

To regenerate the code from the TypeSpec specification:

```powershell
./scripts/Invoke-CodeGen.ps1
```

This script:
1. Installs npm dependencies (`npm ci`)
2. Builds the TypeSpec emitter and generator in `codegen/`
3. Compiles the TypeSpec specification and generates C# code into `src/Generated/`

**Note:** Any modifications to files in `src/Generated/` will be overwritten on the next code generation. To customize behavior, add or modify files in `src/Custom/` instead.

## API Surface and Compatibility

### Exporting the Public API

When making changes that affect the public API surface, run the export script to update the API listings in the `api/` folder:

```powershell
./scripts/Export-Api.ps1
```

This generates `OpenAI.net*.cs` files that document the public API for each target framework.

### API Compatibility Check

To check for breaking changes against a baseline version:

```powershell
./scripts/Test-ApiCompatibility.ps1
```

This compares the current build against the specified baseline NuGet package version and reports any API incompatibilities.

### AOT Compatibility Check

To verify Native AOT compatibility:

```powershell
./scripts/Test-AotCompatibility.ps1
```

This publishes a test application with AOT and checks for trimming warnings.

## Documentation Snippets

Code snippets in documentation are synchronized from actual test code. After modifying snippets in the `tests/Snippets/` folder, run:

```powershell
./scripts/Update-Snippets.ps1
```

This updates the corresponding snippets in markdown documentation files.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass (`dotnet test OpenAI.slnx`)
- [ ] If you modified the public API, run `./scripts/Export-Api.ps1` and commit the updated `api/` files
- [ ] If you modified code snippets, run `./scripts/Update-Snippets.ps1` and commit any updated documentation
- [ ] If you regenerated code, include the regenerated files in a separate commit for easier review
- [ ] Consider running `./scripts/Test-ApiCompatibility.ps1` and `./scripts/Test-AotCompatibility.ps1` to verify compatibility
