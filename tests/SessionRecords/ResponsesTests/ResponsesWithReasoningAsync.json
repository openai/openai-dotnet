I’ll provide a step-by-step method with tips for different tortilla sizes. First, I'll cover steaming or heating the tortillas and how to place the filling. Then, I can explain the envelope fold and the tuck-and-roll methods. It’s important to avoid overfilling and to seal properly by toasting the seam-side down. I should also mention foil wrapping and troubleshoot if tortillas crack, suggesting fresher or larger options. I'll keep it concise!"

                "text": "Here’s a reliable, neat fold that keeps fillings in and holds up to eating:\n\n1) Warm the tortilla\n- Use a 10–12 inch flour tortilla (corn cracks more easily).\n- Heat 15–30 seconds per side in a dry pan or 20–30 seconds in the microwave wrapped in a damp paper towel until pliable.\n\n2) Place the filling correctly\n- Keep all fillings in a horizontal line across the center, slightly closer to you than the center.\n- Use less than you think: about 1 to 1.5 cups total. Put heavier items (rice/beans/meat) on the bottom, then cheese, then wet items (salsa/guac/sour cream) last to prevent sogginess.\n- Leave 1–2 inches clear on the left and right edges.\n\n3) Fold the sides\n- Fold the left and right edges toward the center so they just overlap the ends of the filling line. This creates “walls.”\n\n4) Tuck and roll\n- Lift the edge closest to you up and over the filling, tucking it snugly underneath with your fingers to compress.\n- Roll away from you, keeping it tight so the side folds stay closed. Continue rolling until the seam is underneath.\n\n5) Set the seam\n- Place seam-side down in a hot pan for 30–60 seconds to lightly toast and seal, or wrap tightly in foil with the seam down.\n\nTips and fixes:\n- Overfilling is the #1 cause of blowouts. If it struggles to close, remove a bit.\n- If the tortilla cracks, it’s too cold or dry—rewarm, or lightly brush the inside with a bit of water or oil and reheat.\n- For extra-juicy fillings, line the tortilla with cheese or rice first to act as a moisture barrier.\n- For portable burritos, wrap in foil, twisting the ends. Peel back the foil as you eat.\n- Big burrito option: use a 12-inch tortilla or two overlapped tortillas for “Mission-style” size.\n\nThat’s it—warm, place, fold sides, tuck, tight roll, and set the seam."
