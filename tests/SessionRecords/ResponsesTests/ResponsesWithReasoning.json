I’ll provide clear, step-by-step instructions for an effective method. First, I’ll suggest warming the tortilla, then placing the filling in the center and folding the bottom up over it. Next, I’ll guide folding the sides inward before finally rolling it up to secure everything tightly. I want to ensure the ingredients are balanced, so the burrito remains neat. I'll produce these instructions."

                "text": "Here's a step-by-step method that many consider the best way to fold a burrito for a neat, secure wrap:\n\n1. Warm the tortilla: Use a flour tortilla large enough to hold all your fillings. Warming it slightly (by heating in a dry skillet or microwave) makes it more pliable and less likely to tear.\n\n2. Lay out the tortilla: Place it on a clean surface. Imagine it as a clock face to help guide your folds.\n\n3. Add the filling: Spoon in your chosen ingredients (rice, beans, meat or veggies, cheese, salsa, etc.) roughly in a line across the center of the tortilla. Keep the filling away from the edges (leaving about 2 inches free on the sides) to allow room for folding.\n\n4. Fold the bottom edge: Imagine the bottom of the tortilla is at the 6 o’clock position. Fold it upward over the filling so it covers about a third or half of the ingredients. This initial fold tucks in one side of the burrito.\n\n5. Tuck in the sides: Next, fold the left and right sides inward (toward the center) so that they overlap the filling slightly. These folds help contain the ingredients and prevent them from spilling out.\n\n6. Roll it up: Starting from the bottom (where you made your initial fold), roll the burrito tightly and evenly. Use your thumbs and fingers to keep the burrito snug as you roll. The earlier folds help keep everything contained.\n\n7. Final check: Once rolled, make sure the ends are neatly tucked and the burrito is secure. If you’re not eating immediately, you can wrap it in foil to help it keep its shape and retain heat.\n\nTip: If your burrito is stuffed with a lot of wet ingredients, consider putting drier foods (like rice or cheese) at the edges to act as a barrier. Also, don’t overfill; too many ingredients make it harder to fold and might cause spillage.\n\nThis method produces a well-structured burrito that holds together better whether you’re eating it on the go or packing it for later. Enjoy your perfect, neatly folded burrito!"
