I'll also touch on variations for wet fillings and sizes, suggesting using a rice barrier to soak up moisture. It’s important to keep it concise and practical!"

If I have a very full filling, I can use the envelope method by folding the bottom up, tucking the sides in, then rolling it from the top down. Wrapping it in foil can help keep everything together. I should also mention common mistakes and clarify that smaller tortillas should be used for tacos, not burritos. Keeping it actionable is key!"

Don’t overfill.\n\n3) Start the fold\n- Fold the left and right sides in so they just overlap the filling.\n\n4) Tuck and roll\n- Lift the bottom edge up over the filling.\n- Tuck it back toward you to compress and tighten.\n- Roll forward away from you, keeping sides tucked, until seam is underneath.\n\n5) Set the seam\n- Rest seam-side down for 30 seconds, or toast the seam on a dry pan to seal.\n- For transport, wrap snugly in foil; cut through foil to eat.\n\nTips\n- Super-saucy fillings: add cheese/rice first, then meat/veg, sauce last in a thin line.\n- Overfilled burrito: use the “envelope” variation—bottom up, sides in, top down, then roll.\n- Add crunch: toast the rolled burrito on all sides.\n- If your tortilla is smaller than 10 inches, make two smaller burritos or tacos instead of overstuffing one."
