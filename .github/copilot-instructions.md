## TypeSpec Code Generation

When making changes to TypeSpec files (`.tsp` files), you must regenerate the code by running the following script:

```powershell
./scripts/Invoke-CodeGen.ps1
```

This ensures that any modifications to the TypeSpec definitions are properly reflected in the generated code.
